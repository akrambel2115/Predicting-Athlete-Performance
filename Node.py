class Node:
    """
    A node in the search tree representing a state in the search space.
    
    Each node contains a state (day, fatigue, risk, performance, history),
    a reference to its parent node, the action that led to this state,
    and various cost metrics used by search algorithms.

        g: Path cost from start to this node
        f: Total evaluation function value (g + h)
        h: Heuristic value (estimated cost to goal)
